# Trick to Continuously Forward Multiple Messages on Telegram

🔄 **Trick to Continuously Forward Multiple Messages on Telegram** 🔄

🌟Telegram, a popular messaging platform, imposes limitations on forwarding multiple messages within a short period. When these limits are exceeded, forwarding activities are temporarily suspended. To address this issue and maintain seamless forwarding, we recommend using multiple Telegram accounts instead of relying on just one.

**🔍 Step-by-Step Guide:**

1️⃣ **Create Multiple Telegram Accounts**

👉 Register multiple Telegram accounts, one for each forwarding operation you require.

2️⃣ **Determine the Number of Messages and Chats to Forward**

👉 Calculate the total number of messages and groups chats you want to forward within a specific time frame.

3️⃣ **Divide the Forwarding Task Among Multiple Accounts**

👉 For instance, if you intend to forward to 100 groups chats, divide them among 5 Telegram accounts, with each account handling forward to 20 groups chats.

4️⃣ **Set Up Forwarding on Each Account**

👉 Configure the forwarding settings on each account to forward the desired chats.

5️⃣ **Manage and Monitor Forwarding Operations**

👉 Maintain a list of your Telegram accounts and the number of chats forwarded by each.

🚨 Important Note: Before implementing this trick, be aware that forwarding a large number of messages may violate Telegram's terms of service. It is essential to use this feature responsibly and within the platform's guidelines.

By following this approach, you can effectively overcome Telegram's forwarding limitations and maintain uninterrupted forwarding of messages across multiple accounts. Happy forwarding! 🚀📬
