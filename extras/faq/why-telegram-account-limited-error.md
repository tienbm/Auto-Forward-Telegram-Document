# Why Telegram Account Limited Error?

{% hint style="info" %}
**Telegram Account Limited Error** is an error which happens when an account sends many messages at once. This does not cause any permanent issues with the account. When this error happens **Auto Forward Messages BOT** will not send any more messages via the account. This is because Telegram gives a Temporary Wait Limit so **Auto Forward Messages BOT** will need to for that to expire before it sends another message.
