* **Click Start BOT:** All your forwarding tasks will be start and restart all
* **Click Stop BOT:** All your forwarding tasks will be stopped all
* **DISCONNECT ACCOUNT(**_**No Recommend**_**):** This action will remove your account from Auto Forward Messages bot, all data about you such as membership packages, tasks, blacklists, whitelists, replaces ...etc. will be permanently deleted from our database.
*   **Boost Performance:** This option increases Auto Forward Performance

    * The reason this option is OFF (ðŸš«) by default is because using it will cause BOT to forward messages out of order.
    * If you do not care about message order, turning this setting ON (âœ…) will increase performance by a big margin.


* **Alert: Chat Access Error:** This is the option to ON or OFF error messages when there are problems related to access during message forwarding.&#x20;
